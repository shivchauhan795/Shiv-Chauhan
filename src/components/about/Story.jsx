                My interest in development started in school when I was studying in class 10. Computer lab, different computer accessories always fascinates me. Lab class was my favorite and in class 10 when I reached the lab one fine day, I found something written on a dark blue screen of the monitor. This was the time when my teacher told me about coding and building products through it.
